# Contributing

If you are willing to contribute to Compage, kindly follow the guidelines
here [contributors](https://github.com/intelops/compage/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Thank you for your contribution!

## Contributing to the docs

- The best way to get started is by reading
  the ["Contributor.md"](https://www.compage.dev/blog/how-to-contribute-to-compage?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=referral)
  along with the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/intelops/compage/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- The docs are in the code repository itself under /docs directory. The documentation is created using based on famous
  framework `Docusaurus`.
- Afterwards, go ahead and **fork** the compage [repository](https://github.com/intelops/compage). Make any changes you
  want to your fork, and when you're ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request.

- If it takes longer than expected to get feedback from the `Compage by IntelOps` team, head over to
  the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DeapQc22qe) and **ping** a IntelOps staff member either in the `#general`
  or `#feedback` channel, unless you are a member of the private `contributor` channel. You can always request access to
  this channel.

- Once your pull request has been opened, it will be assigned to one or more reviewers. Those reviewers will do a
  thorough code review, looking for correctness, bugs, opportunities for improvement, documentation, comments, and
  style.

- Make sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation when creating or modifying features. Once you’ve
  received review and approval, your commits are squashed, and your PR is ready for merging.

- Congrats you’re officially a Compage contributor 🎊
