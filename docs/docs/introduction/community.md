# Community

## Our mission

The `Compage by IntelOps` community consists of people having industry experience of more than 30 years, we rally around
one mission though which is:

> Assist developers in building software with proper set of tools, frameworks, smoothening developer's workflow by
> having secured practices in place. Sharing is caring!

You can participate and/or [contribute](/docs/contributing.md) to the community.

## Discord Server

For any assistance, please reach out to use on [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DeapQc22qe), it is an open and
inclusive place, you can interact with the maintainers or simply hang out with the community and talk about anything
around cloud-native, microservices, security and DevOps.

## Community calls

We will soon have a few slots open for one-to-one connect with our core-developers. We encourage you to book time with
the developers to understand the `Compage by IntelOps` better or share the idea.
